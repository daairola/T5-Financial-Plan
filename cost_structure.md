  Every company that intends to maximize the profit must begin by developing a business plan which describes the business 
future and how to achieve it. Prior research must be conducted so as to ensure efficiency and whether the plan is 
viable. 

 # Cost Structure
 
  A cost structure model is required to plan and to communicate the costs required to implement the strategy. This basically 
entails a a designation of either fixed or variable, the proportional size of each category,  and high-level categorization 
of costs. The business requires a technological startup model. Here, there is less or no variable cost since minimum revenue 
is attained. However,  it contains several fixed costs which include, but not limited to,  promotions and advertising, 
computing fees, travel costs, software. After the firm has attained maturity and gains additional revenue, its cost structure 
will change dramatically with the variable costs becoming a spend component. The site hosting is $1,000 per month. 
Accourage also needs computer hardware and software at $1,000 to be stationed at a location requiring $1,000.the firm also 
needs to acquire service providers who need $1000 per month. The total start-up cost will sum to $4000. The operational fee 
also needs to be factored in. These can be administrative, payroll, marketing costs.

  Choosing the channel will depend solely on the type of customers supposed to be reached as well as the number of customer 
segments. The main aim is to raise awareness and provide a chance for clients to evaluate the firm. The overhead expenses 
also should be a key consideration in making the plan. Insurance fee and the labor burden should be weighed to ensure that 
it doesn’t exceed the sales. In order to make the company improve its services, Accourage makes allocations for value 
propositions to give room for innovations.

  With considerations of the above-mentioned factors, a well stated financial plan can be developed. A company should always 
ensure that revenue is higher than the expenses.
